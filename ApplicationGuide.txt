Second Step: Click a picture. Please click only one picture.

Third Step: 

1) Add Tag: You can write down the tag you want to add.(One tag each time) 
Attention:If you do not write down anything, it will add white space as tag. You can add same tag many times in your file name, but it will only show one tag in you name history and view tags.  

2)Delete Tag: Show tags you can delete first(Each tag starts with @). Then, you can write down tag you want to delete.
